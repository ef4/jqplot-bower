jqplot-bower
============

A bower shim for jqplot.

I forked from codevinsky/jqplot-bower because I needed to apply a
[bugfix](https://bitbucket.org/cleonello/jqplot/pull-request/69/fixing-infinite-loop/diff)
that upstream jqplot has so far ignored, and I want to be able to
easily deploy via bower.
